# jax_pinns

This project was done in the course of my PhD thesis and is a collection of usefull algorithms and methods for the training 
of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

Here is a short summary of the most usefull features:
- Implementation of a CSG modelling framework using R-Functions
- A Trust Region optimizer with CGSteihaug solver
- Differential operators in forward mode AD
- A differentiable integration module
- Hessian vector products
- An differentiable ode solver
- Implementation of Quaterion rotation
- Some simple domains and useful transformations
- Simple importance sampling algorithm
